        <p>The SCSS syntax uses the file extension .scss. With a few small exceptions, it’s a
            superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. 
            Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the 
            most popular.</p>
