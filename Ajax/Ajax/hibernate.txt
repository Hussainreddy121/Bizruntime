Hibernate
-----------
==> mainly setter and getters are used in frameworks. 
     * Setters are used To set the date into Object in client prgrm whatever develop in xml file.
     * getters are used to read the data.
==> It is an pojo(plan old java object).
==> In hibernate we itself  develop the object and set the data with the help of Setters.
==> All sql commands are same as every database. and functions are not same.
   * hibernate itself creating sql commands.we specify the only which type of database.(dialect clss in hibernate.cfg.xml)
   * (hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto>create) it checks the whether table is availabe or not.
      suppose table is there again new table created and existing data will be removed even it contain data also.
   * (hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto>none) it does not creat new table whatever existing table is there that table only content will be stored. 
      if at all data available it is drop the table again create empty table.
       if it is non it doesnot drop the table and not create new table. 
   * mapping is used to specify the clss names under session factory.
      for every table we specify one mapping  with  cls name.hbm.xml in cfg.xml
  hbm.xml file
  * any no of clses are provide in mapping.
  * if mutilple clses are develop in same package to specify package name.(package="com.lara")
  * In cls body attribute name of cls coloumns name of cls.
     * 2 types of tag 
          1. id and 2. property.
       * id tag is used to primary key coloumn.
       *. property tag is used for general coloumn.
    *. framework id tag is mandatory.
    * in id, property both contain name attribute u specify coloumn name of cls.
    * Hibernate support ORM mapping (object realative mapping)
      * Object of cls is mapping row of table
      * clss is mapping table 
      * attribute of clss is mapping to attribute name of table.
